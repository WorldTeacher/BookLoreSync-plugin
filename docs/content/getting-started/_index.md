2. [Installation](@/getting-started/installation.md) — copy the plugin to KOReader and verify it loads correctly.
3. [Quick Start](@/getting-started/quick-start.md) — five steps to confirm your first session syncs successfully.
4. [First Session Walkthrough](@/getting-started/first-session.md) — a detailed look at what happens under the hood when you open and close a book.

If you are new to the plugin, read these pages in order. The whole process takes about ten minutes.
