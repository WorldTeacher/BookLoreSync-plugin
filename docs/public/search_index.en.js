The plugin will strip them automatically.\nEnter only the base URL — do not append /api or any path. The plugin handles all API routing internally.\nFull HTTPS support is included. Make sure your server certificate is valid if using a public hostname, or configure KOReader to trust your self-signed certificate.\n🔗KOReader credentials\nTap Configure KOReader Account to set the username and password the plugin uses for its primary connection to BookLore.\nThese credentials are used for:\nAuthentication test (GET /api/koreader/users/auth)\nBook lookup by hash (GET /api/koreader/books/by-hash/:hash)\nSession upload (POST /api/v1/reading-sessions)\nThe password is stored in plain text in the local settings database. When making requests to the KOReader sync endpoint, the plugin hashes it to MD5 on the fly and sends it as the x-auth-key header.\nThe username and password should match your BookLore account credentials.\n🔗BookLore credentials\nTap Configure BookLore Account to enter credentials for the extended API features.\nThese credentials are used for:\nRating sync (PUT /api/v1/books/personal-rating)\nAnnotation sync (POST /api/v1/annotations, POST /api/v2/book-notes)\nBook search (GET /api/v1/books/search)\nThe plugin logs in with these credentials to obtain a Bearer token (JWT) from POST /api/v1/auth/login. The token is cached in the local database and refreshed automatically when it is within 24 hours of expiry.\nIn most setups, the KOReader account and BookLore account are the same user. You can set both to the same username and password.\n🔗Test Connection\nTap Test Connection to verify that:\nThe server is reachable at the configured URL.\nThe KOReader credentials are accepted.\nThe button is only enabled once a server URL and username have been entered.\nA successful test shows:\nA failed test shows a specific error message — for example, if the server is unreachable, if credentials are wrong, or if the health endpoint returns an unexpected status.\nYou can also use the dispatcher action TestBookloreConnection to test the connection from a KOReader gesture or button shortcut. See Gestures and Buttons for how to set this up.\n🔗How authentication works\nThe plugin uses two separate authentication mechanisms depending on the API endpoint being called:\nMechanismHeaderUsed for\nMD5 credentialsx-auth-user / x-auth-keySession upload, book lookup\nBearer token (JWT)Authorization: Bearer &lt;token&gt;Ratings, annotations, book search\nYou do not need to manage tokens manually — the plugin handles acquisition and refresh automatically.","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/configuration/authentication/","title":"Authentication"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/configuration/manage-sessions/":{"body":"🔗Manage Sessions\nFound at: Tools → BookLore Sync → Settings → Manage Sessions\nThis menu contains five actions: Sync Pending Now, View Details, Match Unmatched Books, Clear Pending, and Clear Cache.\n🔗Sync Pending Now\nImmediately uploads all pending sessions, ratings, and annotations to the server.\nThe label shows the current queue sizes when items are waiting — for example Sync Pending Now (3s, 1a, 2r) means 3 sessions, 1 annotation, and 2 ratings are queued. The entry is greyed out when all three queues are empty.\nUploads proceed in three phases: ratings first, then annotations, then sessions. Sessions are sent in a batch of up to 100 at a time. Any session whose BookLore book ID is not yet known is resolved against the server first; if resolution fails, that session is skipped and retried next time.\nWhen complete, a summary toast shows how many items were synced and how many failed.\nFailed items are never discarded automatically. They stay in the queue and are retried on every subsequent sync attempt.\n🔗View Details\nDisplays a read-only summary of the current local database state. No data is modified.\nSectionWhat it shows\nBook cacheTotal books seen, how many have a resolved BookLore ID (matched), and how many do not (unmatched)\nPending uploadsCount of sessions, annotations, and ratings waiting to be sent to the server\nThe dialog stays open until you tap to dismiss it.\n🔗Match Unmatched Books\nAttempts to resolve books in the local cache that do not yet have a BookLore ID. The label shows the unmatched count when it is greater than zero — for example Match Unmatched Books (4). The entry is greyed out when all books are already matched or the cache is empty.\nA network connection is required. If the device is offline, a brief error toast is shown and nothing further happens.\nAutomatic resolution\nThe plugin queries the server for each unmatched book using its file fingerprint (MD5 hash). If the server recognises the book, the BookLore ID is stored in the local cache. Any pending sessions, ratings, and annotations for newly matched books are synced silently in the background.\nManual resolution\nIf automatic resolution finds no new matches but unmatched books remain, a confirmation dialog asks whether to proceed with manual matching. Tapping Yes steps through each unmatched book:\nBookLore is searched by the book's title or filename.\nUp to five results are shown with title, author, and a match-score percentage.\nTap a result to confirm the match, or tap Skip this book to leave it unmatched for now.\nWhen a match is confirmed, the plugin immediately uploads any pending items for that book.\nBooks that cannot be found on the server remain unmatched until the book is added to BookLore. Run Match Unmatched Books again after adding new books to your library.\n🔗Clear Pending\nPermanently discards items from the pending upload queues. The label shows the current queue sizes when items are waiting — for example Clear Pending... (3s, 0a, 2r). The entry is greyed out when all queues are empty.\nTapping the entry opens a dialog listing only the queue types that currently have items, each pre-selected. Uncheck any type you want to keep, then tap Clear Selected to delete the checked queues. Tap Cancel to close without making any changes.\nAlready-synced sessions in historical_sessions and book–ID mappings in book_cache are not affected.\nWarning: Cleared items are permanently deleted and will not be uploaded to BookLore. There is no undo. Use this only to discard data you are sure you do not want — for example, test sessions from initial setup.\n🔗Clear Cache\nRemoves all entries from the book_cache table. The entry is greyed out when the cache is already empty.\nThe cache stores the mapping between each local file and its BookLore book ID, along with the file fingerprint and metadata such as title, author, and ISBN. Clearing it does not affect pending sessions, ratings, or annotations.\nThe cache rebuilds automatically: the next time you open a book, the plugin recalculates its fingerprint, queries the server, and repopulates the cache entry.\nUse this after reorganising your library (for example, after moving many files to different folders) to force the plugin to rebuild all file-path-to-book mappings cleanly. No confirmation dialog is shown — the cache is cleared immediately.","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/configuration/manage-sessions/","title":"Manage Sessions"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/configuration/preferences/":{"body":"🔗Preferences\nThe preferences settings are found at:\nTools → BookLore Sync → Settings → Preferences\n🔗Silent Mode\nDefault: Off\nWhen enabled, the plugin suppresses all popup notifications related to session caching, sync results, and upload confirmations.

Both sessions are uploaded to BookLore separately.\n🔗Duration formatting\nSession durations are displayed in human-readable format in notifications:\n🔗Book fingerprinting\nEach book is identified by an MD5 fingerprint computed from strategic byte samples of the file.

This is the same algorithm used by BookLore's KOReader sync endpoint — it does not read the whole file, just strategic byte ranges, so it is fast even on large files.\nThe fingerprint is cached in the local database so it is only calculated once per file.

When the plugin next attempts to sync (on resume, on the next session end, or via manual sync), it re-queries the server using the cached hash to resolve the ID before uploading.\n🔗Progress tracking\nProgress is recorded as a percentage from 0.0 to 100.\nEPUB: reported by KOReader's EPUB rendering engine as a fractional position in the document.\nPDF / CBZ / CBR: calculated as (current_page / total_pages) * 100.\nProgress is always stored locally at full precision.

The plugin handles all API routing internally.\nKOReader credentials — tap Configure KOReader Account and enter your username and password. These are the credentials you set in the BookLore Settings -&gt; Devices -&gt; KOReader.\nBooklore account — tap Configure Booklore Account and enter the same (or a separate) username and password. This second set of credentials is used for extended features like rating and annotation sync. This is the user you use to log in in the webUI.\nTap Test Connection to verify everything is working.\nA confirmation message will appear if the connection succeeds.\n🔗\n🔗Next steps\nOnce the plugin is installed and connected, follow the Quick Start guide to confirm your first session syncs correctly.","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/getting-started/installation/","title":"Installation"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/getting-started/introduction/":{"body":"🔗BookLore Sync\nBookLore Sync is a KOReader plugin that automatically tracks your reading sessions and syncs them — along with ratings, highlights, and notes — to your self-hosted BookLore server.\n🔗What does it do?\nWhen you read a book in KOReader, the plugin silently records your session — when you started, when you stopped, how many pages you covered, and your current progress. When you close the book (or the device wakes from sleep), it uploads that session to your BookLore server.\nIf you are offline, sessions are queued locally and uploaded the next time a connection is available.\nBeyond session tracking, the plugin also supports:\nRating sync — push your KOReader star rating to BookLore automatically, or pick a score on a 1–10 scale when you finish a book.\nHighlights and notes sync — upload annotations made in KOReader to BookLore, either attached to the passage (in-book) or as standalone notes on the book page.\nAuto-update — the plugin can check for and install updates from GitHub without leaving KOReader.\n🔗Feature overview\nFeatureStatus\nAutomatic session trackingFully implemented\nOffline queue with auto-retryFully implemented\nBatch session upload (up to 100)Fully implemented\nBook rating syncFully implemented\nHighlights and notes syncFully implemented\nEPUB CFI position for annotationsFully implemented\nAuto-update from GitHubFully implemented\nSupported formats: EPUB, PDF, CBZ, CBRFully implemented\nManual sync modeFully implemented\nSQLite local database with migrationsFully implemented\n🔗Supported formats\nThe plugin works with any book format that KOReader can open:\nEPUB — full support, including EPUB CFI generation for precise annotation positioning\nPDF — page-based progress tracking\nCBZ / CBR — comic/archive formats with page-based tracking\n🔗Quick navigation\nNew here?

It takes about five minutes.\n🔗Step 1 — Open a book\nOpen any book in KOReader that exists in your BookLore library.\nBehind the scenes, the plugin immediately:\nCalculates an MD5 fingerprint of the book file.\nQueries your BookLore server to resolve the book's ID using that fingerprint.\nRecords your starting progress and the current timestamp.\nIf the book is not found on the server, the session is still saved locally — the book ID will be resolved automatically the next time a connection is available.\n🔗Step 2 — Read for at least 30 seconds\nBy default, sessions shorter than 30 seconds are discarded. Read a few pages to ensure the session clears the validation threshold.\nYou can adjust this threshold later in Settings → Sync Settings → Session Settings → Minimum Duration.\n🔗Step 3 — Close the book\nReturn to the KOReader home screen or library. The plugin triggers on book close and:\n🔗If the upload succeeds, a brief notification appears (unless Silent Mode is enabled).\n🔗Step 4 — Check BookLore\nOpen your BookLore web interface and navigate to the book you just read.
